            When text is rendered by a computer, sometimes characters are displayed as “tofu”. They are little boxes to indicate your device doesn’t have a font to display the text.

        <h3>And here again</h3>
        <p>
            Google has been developing a font family called Noto, which aims to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is Google’s answer to tofu. The name noto is to convey the idea that Google’s goal is to see “no more tofu”. Noto has multiple
            styles and weights, and is freely available to all. The comprehensive set of fonts and tools used in our development is available in our GitHub repositories.
